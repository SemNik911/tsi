    <p>Sir Sly is an American indie rock band formed and based in Orange County, California, United States. The band is fronted by vocalist Landon 
        Jacobs with instrumentalists Jason Suwito and Hayden Coplen accompanying him. The trio gradually built a steady following and managed to 
        top The Hype Machine chart, eventually revealing their identities.

    <p>Landon Jacobs, the 30-year-old frontperson of the California rock band Sir Sly, said in a recent interview: "That's what's kind of fun about
        music. You get to wear your inspirations on your sleeve and then mix that with what is going on in your own life. It's always going to come
        out differently than what anyone else could do, even if they sat down and tried to synthesize all those things." The mingling of a person's
        musical influences combined with what's going on in one's own life results in something fresh and unique, according to Jacobs, and is at the
        heart of his creative process.

    <p>As we begin to wrap April, it's still anyone's guess as to when live music will actually return with some sense of normalcy. So if a band is set
        to announce a Fall 2021 tour, best to make it quite literally at the back end of The Greatest Season, giving us all ample time to see just what
        will transpire over the next several months. That seems to be the plan from Los Angeles alt-pop trio lovelytheband, who have unveiled their
        24-date "Conversations with Loverboy" co-headlining North American tour with Sir Sly that picks up in mid-November and takes them to
        Christmas. As an exciting bonus, CANNONS and their unfuckwithable song "Fire For You," are on board as special guests for the entire run.
