				<p style="width: 80vw; padding-right: 20px;">Musician Damon Albarn and comic artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when 
					guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, which Albarn and Coxon had recently 
					formed. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett 
					initially thought Albarn was "arsey, a wanker;" and despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did 
					not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and 
					Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver 
					and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica.

				<p style="width: 80vw; padding-right: 20px;">
					Drawing upon environmentalist themes, Plastic Beach was inspired by the idea of a "secret floating island deep in 
					the South Pacific... made up of the detritus, debris and washed up remnants of humanity" inspired by marine pollution 
					such as plastic that Albarn had found in a beach near one of his homes in Devon as well as the Great Pacific garbage 
					patch. Unlike previous Gorillaz albums, Albarn made the decision to produce Plastic Beach by himself, with no 
					co-producer. The album was recorded throughout 2008 and 2009 in London, New York City and Syria although production 
					of the album was briefly interrupted so that Albarn could join Blur for a reunion tour in the summer of 2009, with 
					Albarn explaining "there's no way you can do that and that [Blur and Gorillaz] at the same time.

				<p style="width: 80vw;padding-right: 20px;">On 17 September 2021, Albarn revealed that he had recorded a new Gorillaz 
					song with Bad Bunny while in Jamaica, and, at the time, said it would be the first single for a new album, influenced 
					by Latin America, releasing in 2022. The concept for the album would later change, with the song being announced 
					at a later date. On 31 August 2022, the name of this song was revealed to be "Tormenta".

					In November 2021, Albarn announced that an animated film based on the band was in the works at Netflix, but by February 
					2023, it had been cancelled.
